Number of User Views Prediction

The more active our users are, the higher the load on our servers. Recently, we have been receiving more and more complaints about the app freezing.

I was asked to contribute by forecasting how user activity will change over the next month. So I have to:
- Choose the key metric to forecast.
- Determine the time resolution.
- Identify any additional regressors that to include in the model.
- Build and validate the model. Do we have enough data for backtesting in this task? If not, determine for what forecast horizon we do have enough data.
- Select the model that appears to be the most suitable (justify your choice).
- Interpret the modelâ€™s results. If there are any important limitations in the conclusions.
